# Feature Specification: Improve Test Coverage for nanoAI

**Feature Branch**: `005-improve-test-coverage`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Improve test coverage focusing on areas listed in docs/todo-next.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Establish the baseline: document current automated test coverage across ViewModel, UI, and data layers.
2. Prioritize the at-risk experiences cited in docs/todo-next.md and define measurable coverage goals for each layer.
3. Design user-centric test scenarios that validate happy paths, error handling, and accessibility expectations.
4. Introduce automated coverage reporting so stakeholders can monitor gains after each build.
5. Review results with product, QA, and engineering leads; capture follow-up actions for any remaining blind spots.
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Keep the focus on reliability signals that matter to end users and release stakeholders.
- ✅ Ensure new test assets document expected Material UX, accessibility, and offline behaviors.
- ❌ Avoid prescribing tooling or implementation tactics; concentrate on outcomes and guardrails.
- 🎯 Provide transparency into coverage progress so future teams can maintain the quality bar.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the release steward for nanoAI, I need trustworthy, automated insight into how thoroughly our critical user journeys are tested so that I can approve releases with confidence and respond quickly to regressions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a scheduled build on the release branch, **When** coverage reports are generated, **Then** the release steward sees a summary segmented by ViewModel, UI, and data layers showing progress against agreed targets.
2. **Given** a new risk scenario is identified in discovery (e.g., prompt editing flow), **When** the team adds automated tests, **Then** the coverage summary updates to reflect the added protections and highlights any remaining untested states.
3. **Given** the device farm is offline or unavailable, **When** automated UI or data tests are queued, **Then** the system defers execution gracefully and flags the need for a rerun without blocking visibility into existing coverage metrics.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when new modules are introduced without associated automated tests? (Coverage summary must flag gaps and trigger follow-up actions.)
- How does the system handle flaky tests that intermittently fail and distort coverage confidence?
- How is coverage tracked for features guarded behind remote configuration or feature flags?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The program MUST publish a consolidated coverage summary for ViewModel, UI, and data layers after every CI build so stakeholders can assess readiness.
- **FR-002**: Automated verification MUST exist for all critical ViewModel state transitions (happy path, error, loading) referenced in docs/todo-next.md, ensuring regressions are detected before release.
- **FR-003**: Critical Compose UI flows (conversation list, chat detail, message composition) MUST have automated scenarios that validate user-facing behavior, accessibility, and Material design compliance.
- **FR-004**: Data access paths (Room DAOs, repositories, caching rules) MUST have automated checks that confirm read/write integrity, error propagation, and offline resilience promises.
- **FR-005**: Coverage reporting MUST surface trend data and highlight areas below the target threshold so leadership can prioritize subsequent hardening work.
- **FR-006**: Coverage targets MUST meet or exceed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specify percentage or metric thresholds for each layer].

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05

- Q: Choose coverage thresholds for ViewModel / UI / Data → A: Moderate — ViewModel 75% / UI 65% / Data 70%.

### Applied clarifications
- FR-006 updated: Coverage targets set to ViewModel 75% / UI 65% / Data 70%.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Coverage Summary**: Business-facing report that groups metrics by app layer, callouts for gaps, and historical trend snapshots.
- **Critical Test Suite Catalog**: Indexed inventory of automated test suites mapped to user journeys, including owner, scenario intent, and dependencies.
- **Risk Register**: Shared tracker of open coverage gaps, mitigations, and deadlines agreed upon by product, QA, and engineering leads.
