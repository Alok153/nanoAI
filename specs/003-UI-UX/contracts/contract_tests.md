# Contract Tests (placeholder)

These are contract test placeholders generated by the plan. They are intended to fail until the API or implementation is available.

Files to add under this directory:
- `test_user_profile_contract.kt` — tests request/response schema for `/user/profile` endpoint.

Guidance: Use the project's testing framework (JUnit + MockWebServer) to implement these tests. Each test should assert request/response shapes and error handling behavior.

```
