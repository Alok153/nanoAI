## Phase Dependencies
- Setup → Foundational → User Stories (US1–US5 in priority order) → Polish
- Foundational tasks T004–T010 block all story phases; US phases can proceed in parallel after Foundational completes, respecting per-task dependencies.

## Parallel Opportunities
- Tasks marked [P] can be executed in parallel where file paths do not overlap (e.g., T001–T003, T007–T008, T011–T012, T017–T018).
