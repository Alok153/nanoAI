# Next Development Phase: Post-Coverage Initiative

Based on the completed 005-improve-test-coverage feature and codebase analysis, the nanoAI project now has a robust test foundation with automated quality gates. This document outlines the next development priorities, focusing on reaching target coverage thresholds, expanding multimodal capabilities, and continuing UX polish.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13 (Post-Coverage Initiative Completion)

## Phase 1: Coverage Threshold Achievement (High Priority)

### Closing the Gap
The current coverage snapshot (2025-10-12) shows significant gaps from target thresholds:
- ViewModel: 39.58% → **Target 75%** (35.42pp gap)
- UI: 1.90% → **Target 65%** (63.10pp gap)  
- Data: 18.91% → **Target 70%** (51.09pp gap)

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] **Expand ViewModel test coverage**: Focus on high-traffic ViewModels (`ChatViewModel`, `MessageComposerViewModel`, `HistoryViewModel`, `ModelLibraryViewModel`) with comprehensive unit tests covering state transitions, error handling, and offline scenarios.
- [ ] **Increase UI test coverage**: Add instrumentation tests for critical Compose screens and components that lack coverage (Home Screen, Chat Interface, Model Library, Settings), ensuring TalkBack semantics and accessibility compliance.
- [ ] **Strengthen Data layer tests**: Expand Room DAO tests, Repository tests with MockWebServer scenarios, and DataStore preference tests to validate offline-first behavior and data persistence.
- [ ] **Address failing test scenarios**: Resolve incomplete implementations flagged in risk register (RR-CRIT-041, RR-HIGH-027, RR-HIGH-033) to bring tests to passing state.
- [ ] **Enable full CI coverage**: Ensure CI runs `./gradlew ciManagedDeviceDebugAndroidTest jacocoFullReport` with hardware virtualization to collect complete unit + instrumentation coverage (not just unit-only fallback).

### Coverage-Related Improvements
- [ ] Refine layer classification map (`config/coverage/layer-map.json`) as new modules are added.
- [ ] Add telemetry for coverage trend monitoring (already scaffolded in `CoverageTelemetryReporter`).
- [ ] Set up automated coverage badges/dashboards for PR review visibility.
- [ ] Schedule weekly risk register reviews to keep mitigation plans current.

## Phase 2: Resolved Flows & Test Infrastructure

### Successfully Completed (Phase 005)
✅ Stabilized managed Pixel 6 API 34 configuration with x86_64 ABI  
✅ Introduced deterministic test harness with `TestEnvironmentRule` for DataStore/Room resets  
✅ Migrated from JUnit4 to JUnit5 (Jupiter) across all test suites  
✅ Implemented TDD workflow with 47 new/enhanced test cases (T003-T029)  
✅ Added typed risk references and threshold enforcement in coverage models  
✅ Implemented `slow_down` backoff handling in `HuggingFaceAuthCoordinator`  
✅ Added cached-fallback logic in `RefreshModelCatalogUseCase`  
✅ Enhanced accessibility support in Compose UI (TalkBack descriptions, semantic tags)  
✅ Wired disclaimer flow with exposure state tracking  
✅ Created comprehensive coverage tooling (JaCoCo merge, threshold verification, risk register)

### Deferred Items (from Phase 005)
- **TODO**: Instrumentation coverage collection on full CI (currently unit-only due to virtualization constraints locally).
- **TODO**: Additional schema validation for coverage JSON in contract tests.
- **TODO**: Performance macrobenchmarks for coverage dashboard warm-load (<100ms target).
- **TODO**: Automated risk escalation notifications when Critical risks remain open past target build.

## Phase 3: Multimodal & Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

Building on the solid test foundation, these features can now be developed with proper TDD:

- [ ] **Integrate image input/output**: Add camera/gallery picker in chat; support vision models (MediaPipe Vision or cloud APIs). Include comprehensive tests for image handling, caching, and offline scenarios.
- [ ] **Enable audio I/O**: Implement speech-to-text and TTS output with accessibility considerations. Test permission flows, audio playback, and offline fallbacks.
- [ ] **Expand runtimes**: Integrate TensorFlow Lite or MLC LLM as secondary local options. Abstract via `LocalModelRuntime` interface with test doubles for each runtime.
- [ ] **Add image generation**: Research on-device Stable Diffusion; integrate cloud options. Create test fixtures for generation scenarios and error handling.
- [ ] **Implement concurrent models**: Allow multiple active inferences with resource monitoring. Test OOM scenarios and graceful degradation.

## Phase 4: UX Polish & Accessibility (Medium Priority)

- [ ] **Enhance onboarding**: Multi-step flow with interactive demos and feature highlights (building on disclaimer implementation).
- [ ] **Accessibility audit**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance check with automated tests; extend TalkBack coverage to dynamic content.
- [ ] **Theme & density refinements**: Support expanded visual density; add custom accent color picker; test theme persistence across process death.
- [ ] **Sidebar enhancements**: Add badges, drag-to-reorder, collapsible sections with proper semantic markup and testing.
- [ ] **Error & offline UX**: Progressive enhancement for queued actions; refine retry animations and offline banners based on instrumentation test findings.

## Phase 5: Performance & Scalability (Low Priority)

- [ ] **Integrate Baseline Profiles**: Target <2s local response, <300ms FMP with macrobenchmark validation.
- [ ] **Security audit**: Encrypt exports optionally; validate imports against schema; test credential masking in logs/UI.
- [ ] **Multi-device sync**: Add optional cloud sync with E2E encryption (requires extensive security testing).
- [ ] **Community models**: Expand library with user-submitted models; add validation workflow with safety tests.
- [ ] **Analytics (opt-in)**: Add privacy-safe local metrics for crashes/performance; no PII, extensive privacy testing.

## Phase 6: Technical Debt & Maintenance

- [ ] **Room/DataStore migration plan**: Clean up legacy data fields removed during feature development (onboarding, dismissed tips).
- [ ] **Detekt baseline refresh**: Address new findings after coverage expansion; update spotless configuration.
- [ ] **Dependency updates**: Regular Context7 MCP checks for library updates; maintain compatibility with AGP/Kotlin versions.
- [ ] **Documentation updates**: Keep API docs, architecture diagrams, and quickstart guides current as features evolve.

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Targets (3-month horizon)
- ViewModel: 39.58% → 75% (by end of Q4 2025)
- UI: 1.90% → 65% (by end of Q4 2025)
- Data: 18.91% → 70% (by end of Q4 2025)

### Quality Gates
- All Critical risks resolved before any production release
- Maximum 2 High-severity risks in-flight at any time
- CI green rate >95% over rolling 30-day window
- Test execution time <20 minutes for full suite

### Development Velocity
- TDD adoption: All new features start with failing tests
- Code review SLA: Tests reviewed within 24 hours
- Documentation debt: All new public APIs documented before merge

## Risks & Dependencies

### Technical Risks
- **Hardware variance**: Multimodal features require extensive testing on low-RAM devices (Pixel 4a+).
- **Flaky tests**: Continue monitoring offline test stability; use emulator mocking for network scenarios.
- **CI resources**: Full instrumentation coverage requires hardware virtualization; ensure CI runners support it.

### Schedule Risks
- Coverage gap closure: Estimated 4-6 weeks of focused effort (could delay multimodal work).
- Risk mitigation: Some items target builds 2-3 sprints out; monitor for slippage.

### Dependencies
- JUnit5 migration complete (unlocks better test parameterization and extensions)
- Coverage tooling operational (enables continuous threshold monitoring)
- Managed device configuration stable (supports deterministic CI runs)
